* ERROR AND MESSAGE PASSING
* This defines a set of codes that can be used to pass errors and messages.
*
* The modelErr structure is used to pass fatal errors.  These errors stop
* processing and cause the erasure of all data.  This puts the model in a state
* ready to be initialized once again.
*
* The modelMsg structure is used to pass non-fatal errors and messages. These
* stop processing but do not cause data erasure.  An object passing one of
* these messages is responsible for internal data cleanup.
