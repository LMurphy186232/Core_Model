/**
* Substrate - Version 2.1
*
* Substrate keeps track of what the forest floor in a particular location is
* made of at any given time.  There are six kinds of substrate: fresh logs,
* decayed logs, scarified soil, tip-up, forest floor litter, and forest floor
* moss.  This behavior tracks the input of new fresh logs and tip-up through
* the fall of dead trees, the changing of substrate conditions due to harvest,
* and the decay of all other substrate types into forest floor litter and moss.
* Forest floor litter and forest floor moss act as a common pool, with one in
* fixed proportion to the other.
*
* Freshly dead live trees have a certain probability of falling to create new
* fresh log substrate, and the fallen have a certain probability of creating
* new tip-up.  Dead snags always contribute new fresh log, and have their own
* probability of creating tip-up.  The amount of fresh logs and tip-up
* contributed by a downed tree depends on the size of the tree.
*
* Trees can collapse vertically to put all of their fresh log area in the grid
* cell in which they are rooted, or they can fall in a random direction and
* contribute fresh log area to more than one cell.  This option is controlled
* by the user.  All tip-up area is always contributed to the cell in which the
* tree is rooted.
*
* The change in substrate contributed by harvest events is set directly in the
* parameter file.  Harvest is the only way to introduce new scarified soil
* substrate.
*
* The substrate behavior will create a grid called "Substrate."  In this grid
* are contained, for each grid cell, the relative proportions of the various
* types of substrate as a value between 0 and 1.
*
* An input of new substrate through mortality or harvest is tracked in a grid
* package.  For a package, the relative proportions of substrate are subjected
* through time to increasing levels of substrate decay, until the package
* reaches the maximum age limit and is removed.  The master grid cell substrate
* proportions are calculated from the input of all the packages associated with
* that cell.
*
* Substrate parameters relating to harvest are not required unless the Harvest
* behavior is being used for a run.
*
* Substrate should be applied to all the species/type combos for trees that can
* contribute to new fresh log generation.  Substrate depends on there being a
* bool data member of the trees called "dead" in these trees (the absence of
* this code being previously defined will cause a fatal error).  The data
* member should have a value of true if a tree is dead.  Dead trees should not
* yet have been removed from the tree population.  Substrate cannot be applied
* to seedlings; trying to do so causes a fatal error.
*
* If Substrate determines that a dead tree falls over, it calls the tree
* population's KillTree() function, with a reason code of "remove", to force
* its removal from memory and to prevent its becoming a snag.  Note that if
* any other behaviors become interested in dead trees, this could be a problem.
*
* The namestring and parameter file call string of this behavior are both
* "Substrate".

  * direction.  The area of the log is divided evenly into h*2 chunks, where
  * h is the tree height in m.  The function walks out the length of the log
  * in 0.5-m intervals, and whatever grid cell the end of the interval falls
