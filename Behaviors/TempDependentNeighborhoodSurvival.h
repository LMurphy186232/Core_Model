/**
* Temperature dependent neighborhood survival - Version 1.0
*
* This is a mortality shell object which calculates survival as a function of
* climate and adult neighbor basal area.
*
* The equation for one year's survival is:
* <center>Probability of survival = exp(-1.0*A*BAT^B)*exp(-0.5*(((X-M)/N)^2))</center>
* where A, B, M, and N are parameters, X is the plot mean annual temperature,
* and BAT is the adult neighborhood basal area within a specified radius,
* in square meters.
*
* Rather than calculate a survival rate for each individual tree, this
* calculates a survival rate for each cell in a grid.  Trees then get the
* survival rate of the grid cell in which they are found. For efficiency,
* the survival rate for a cell is not calculated until there is a tree that
* needs it.
*
* Snags, seedlings, and trees that are already dead from disturbance events are
* never counted in the neighbor count.
*
* For multi year time steps, the annual probability of survival is raised to the
* power of the number of years per time step.
*
* The parameter file call string for this is
* "TempDependentNeighborhoodSurvival". The namestring for this behavior is
* "TempDependentNeighborhoodmortshell".
