/**
* GLI Points File Creator - Version 1.0
*
* This behavior creates a GLI value for each of a list of user-defined points.
* The user includes in the parameter file a points file with a set of X and Y
* coordinates and a height.  For each timestep, this will calculate the GLI
* for each of those points and then write the results to a tab-delimited text
* file.  This behavior does not need to be applied to any trees.  Nothing else
* is done with the GLI values.  This is an analysis behavior that prepares
* some calculations; the user can use the values however they see fit.
*
* The namestring and parameter file call string for this behavior is
* "GLIPointCreator". This class is descended from clGLIBase so it can use its
* light calculation methods, but since the string "lightshell" is ommitted from
* this class's namestring, it should not be treated as a light behavior.
*
* The sky brightness array used by this behavior is potentially identical to
* that for other GLI light behaviors.  Before committing to the calculation of
* a brightness array, this behavior will ask those behaviors if their settings
* are identical.  If they are, and that class has already calculated the
* brightness array, this behavior can just copy.
