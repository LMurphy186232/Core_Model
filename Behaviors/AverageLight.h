/**
* Average Light - Version 1.0
*
* This behavior averages light values taken over a finer scale to a coarser
* resolution.  It gets the light levels for averaging from the GLI Map
* Creator's grid (class clGLIMap). This grid is called "GLI Map X" where X
* is the position in the behavior list. This will average the
* first GLI Map X grid that it finds. Putting multiple copies of the GLI Map
* Creator in a run would be a problem: because of the clLightOrg hooking
* process, it is impossible to guarantee that all copies of GLI Map
* Creator will run before Average Light.
*
* The Average Light behavior produces one grid, called "Average Light".
* The user sets the grid resolution on this grid to control the area over
* which light is averaged, up to the whole plot.
*
* If the grid cell area of Average Light is not an exact multiple of the GLI
* Map grid cell area, then the averaging will be over all the cells touched by
* the Average Light grid, with no weighting for partial cells (see the
* clGrid::GetAverageFloatValue method).
*
* The namestring for this behavior is "averagelightshell"; the parameter file
* call string is "AverageLight".
