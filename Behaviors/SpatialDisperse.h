/**
* Spatial dispersal - Version 1.0
*
* This class creates and disperses seeds according to the spatially-explicit
* model.  Parent trees of greater than the minimum reproductive DBH have the
* number of seeds calculated.  The seeds are dispersed around the plot
* according
* to either the Weibull or Lognormal probability distribution functions.
*
* Forest cover can be taken into account during seed distribution (gap) or
* ignored (non-gap).
*
* This behavior can also be used for suckering of stumps.  If this is desired,
* apply this to the species which sucker, tree type stump.  If this is gap
* disperse, stumps reproduce pretending they're always in gap conditions.  They
* use the probability distribution function of their species' gap function.
* If this is non-gap disperse, they reproduce like other adults of their
* species.
*
* The "seeds" are actually tallies by species in a grid.  This behavior does
* not produce any seedlings.  A separate recruitment behavior must "germinate"
* the seeds into seedlings according to its own rules.
*
* To call this as gap disperse in the parameter file, use the string
* "GapDisperse".  To call this as non-gap disperse, use the string
* "NonGapDisperse".  There is a place in the parameters for indicating which
* probability distribution function should be used under each cover type.
* The namestring for this class is "SpatialDisperse".

  * Performs dispersal of seeds for one tree according to gap disperse.  The

  * STR.
  *
  * Each seed is given a random azimuth angle.  It is then given a random
  * distance that conforms to the probability distribution function of the
  * current forest cover of the parent.  (This distance is gotten by comparing
  * a random value to successive values in the appropriate cumulative
  * probability array until the first array bucket that has a greater value
  * than the random number.)  Once the seed has an azimuth and a distance, the
  * function determines which grid cell it should drop in.
  *
  * Once the seed has a target grid cell, that cell's cover is checked.  Then
  * the seed's survival is evaluated.  If the seed is in the cover type with
  * the higher STR, it automatically survives.  Otherwise, a random number is
  * compared to the ratio of the lower STR to the higher STR to determine if it
  * survives.
  *
  * If the seed survives, it may need to be repositioned.  If both parent and
  * seed are under closed canopy, the seed is dropped where it is.  If the
  * parent is in gap and seedling is in canopy, a new distance is calculated as
  * though the parent was also in canopy.  The shortest of the two distances
  * is used to determine where the seed lands.  If the seed lands in a gap cell,

  * landing cell, checking each intermediate grid cell's cover along the way.
