/**
* GLIMapCreator - Version 1.0
*
* This behavior creates a map of GLI values in a grid.  The user sets the
* height of the point at which to calculate GLI, and then this behavior
* calculates the GLI at that height in the center of each cell.  (This behavior
* is almost identical to clQuadratGliLight, except it doesn't apply light to
* trees and calculates a GLI for every grid cell no matter what.)  This
* behavior does not need to be applied to any trees.
*
* Nothing else is done with the GLI values.  This is an analysis behavior that
* prepares some calculations; the user can output the GLI map grid and then
* use the values however they see fit.
*
* The namestring and parameter file call string for this behavior is
* "GLIMapCreator".  This class is descended from clGLIBase so it can use its
* light calculation methods, but since the string "lightshell" is ommitted from
* this class's namestring, it should not be treated as a light behavior.
*
* The sky brightness array used by this behavior is potentially identical to
* that for other GLI light behaviors.  Before committing to the calculation of
* a brightness array, this behavior will ask those behaviors if their settings
* are identical.  If they are, and that class has already calculated the
* brightness array, this behavior can just copy.
