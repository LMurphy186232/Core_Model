/**
* Light base - Version 1.1
*
* This is the base class for light behavior shell classes. These shells
* implement a common set of functions in different ways which are specific
* to the way light is calculated according to their method.
*
* The bulk of the organizational work is done by the class clLightOrg, which
* calls the needed shell functions for each tree. The clLightOrg object hooks
* into one particular light shell object, which calls clLightOrg when it is
* triggered by the behavior manager. It does not particularly matter which
* shell object is hooked; the first one will suffice. Any non-hooked shells
* do nothing when their Action() and other functions are called. The hooked
* shell also tells this object that it's time to register tree data members.
*
* Every object made from this class or a descendent class must have the string
* "lightshell" in its namestring somewhere. The base class also declares a
* new tree float data member on behalf of each child shell object; the light
* org object then registers it. The descendents don't need to do anything.
* The new data member is called "Light", and will store the amount of light
* calculated.
