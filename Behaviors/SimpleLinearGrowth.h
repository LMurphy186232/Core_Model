/**
* Increments growth according to a simple linear equation.  This can be used to
* create a growth increment with no automatic height adjustment, a growth
* increment with automatic height adjustment, or a height increment.
*
* The equation used in this behavior is:
* <center>Y = a + b * GLI</center>
* where
* <ul>
* <li>Y = either radial growth in mm/year or height growth in cm/yr
* <li>a = growth intercept
* <li>b = growth slope
* <li>GLI is global light index, from 0 to 100
* </ul>
*
* The name string is "simplelineargrowthshell".  In the parameter file:  For
* diameter growth with no automatic height adjustment, call "SimpleLinearGrowth
* diam only".  For diameter growth with automatic height adjustment,
* call "SimpleLinearGrowth".  For height growth, call "SimpleLinearGrowth
* height only".
