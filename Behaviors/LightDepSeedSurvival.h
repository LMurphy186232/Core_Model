/**
* Light Dependent Seed Survival - Version 1.1
*
* This behavior assesses seed survival based on light levels.  The starting
* number of seeds is created by any disperse behavior and placed in the grid
* "Dispersed Seeds".  The number of seeds surviving out of this number is a
* function of GLI.  Because of the need to calculate light levels, this class
* descends from clGLIBase.
*
* The number of seeds of a given species that survive in a particular
* "Dispersed Seeds" grid cell is:
* <br><center>R<sub>sp</sub> = S<sub>sp</sub> * LE</center><br>
* where:
* <ul>
* <li>R<sub>sp</sub> is the number of seeds surviving</li>
* <li>S<sub>sp</sub> is the starting number of seeds of the species, i.e.
* the number of seeds dispersed to that grid cell
* <li>LE is the light favorability, from 0 to 1</li>
* </ul>
*
* The number of seeds is given a random round.
*
* LE is calculated from GLI as:
* @htmlonly
 <ul>
 <li>If GLI &lt; GLI<sub>opt</sub>, LE = 1 - (S<sub>lo</sub>(GLI<sub>opt</sub> - GLI))</li>
 <li>If GLI = GLI<sub>opt</sub>, LE = 1</li>
 <li>If GLI &gt; GLI<sub>opt</sub>, LE = 1 - (S<sub>hi</sub>(GLI - GLI<sub>opt</sub>))</li>
 </ul>
 @endhtmlonly
* where
* <ul>
* <li>GLI is the global light index - GLI at the center of the "Dispersed Seeds" grid cell at a
* user-specified height</li>
* <li>GLI<sub>opt</sub> is the optimum GLI for the given species</li>
* <li>S<sub>lo</sub> is the slope of the dropoff in light favorability at
* GLIs below GLI<sub>opt</sub></li>
* <li>S<sub>hi</sub> is the slope of the dropoff in light favorability at
* GLIs above GLI<sub>opt</sub></li>
* </ul>
*
* GLI can come in two ways.  The first method is that this behavior will
* calculate GLI like all other GLIs.  There is one difference:  neighbor
* trees that have hurricane damage have different light extinction coefficients
* from their undamaged neighbors. To achieve this, we override the function
* clLightBase::GetLightExtinctionCoefficient().  This effect is not required.
*
* The second way is to get the GLI from the Storm Light grid.
*
* A fatal error will be thrown if a disperse behavior is not used, or if Storm
* Light is the source of GLIs but it is not used.
*
* The namestring and parameter file call string for this class is
* "LightDependentSeedSurvival" (for having this behavior calculate GLI) or
* "StormLightDependentSeedSurvival" (for having Storm Light be the GLI
* source).  Apply this behavior to the desired species;
* use any type, since type will be ignored.
