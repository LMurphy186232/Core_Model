/**
* Carbon Value Calculator Version 1.0
*
* This behavior calculates carbon value per species.  The amount of carbon is
* given by the user as a percent of biomass for each species.  This behavior
* expects the Dimension Analysis behavior (clDimensionAnalysis) to calculate
* tree biomass.
*
* The user also supplies a price per metric ton of carbon.  This is multipled
* by the amount of carbon and added up into a total value of carbon per
* species.  The species carbon totals and carbon value totals are stored in
* a grid called "Carbon Value".
*
* Each tree gets a data member called "Carbon".  This contains the tree's
* own carbon value.
*
* This class's namestring and parameter call string are both
* "CarbonValueCalculator".
*
* This behavior may not be applied to seedlings.
