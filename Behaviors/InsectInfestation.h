/**
* Insect Infestation version 1.0.
*
* This behavior simulates a spreading insect infestation throughout the tree
* population.
*
* The proportion of trees infested as a lognormal function of time is as
* follows:
*
* P = I +((MAX-I)/(1+(T/X0)^Xb))
*
* where:
* <ul>
* <li>P is the proportion infested </li>
* <li>I is the function intercept, or the initial infestation rate </li>
* <li>MAX is the maximum infestation rate </li>
* <li>T is the time since the start of the infestation </li>
* <li>X0 is the time at which 50% of the population is infested </li>
* <li>Xb controls the steepness of the infestation curve </li>
* </ul>
*
* Infestation begins at a time step chosen by the user.  Infestation continues
* until there are no more infested trees in the plot, or the ending timestep
* if the user indicates one.
*
* The proportion of trees infested at time T does not depend on additions to or
* subtractions from the tree population.  The number of trees of a species at
* that time is counted and the number of trees that are newly infested is the
* number required to cause the appropriate proportion to be infested.  If for
* some reason there are more trees infested than there should be at that time,
* no additional trees are infested.
*
* There is no spatial component to the selection of trees for infestation. It is
* assumed that all trees have an equal chance of becoming infested no matter
* where they are in the plot. The number of trees that should be infested for a
* given time step minus the number that actually are gives the probability that
* an uninfested tree will become infested this time step. A random number is
* used against this probability for each uninfested tree to determine whether or
* not it will become infested.
*
* An integer data member is added to trees that tracks the number of years that
* they have been infested.  This data member is called "YearsInfested".
*
* This behavior will not infest trees below a minimum DBH set by the user.
* Because of the need for DBH, obviously seedlings are ignored.
*
* This behavior's call string and name string are both "InsectInfestation".
