/**
* Density Dependent Infestation version 1.0.
*
* This behavior simulates the spread of a disease or infestation throughout a
* tree population.
*
* The proportion of trees infested as a Gompertz function of time is as
* follows:
*
* P = max * exp(-exp(a - b* T))
*
* where:
* <ul>
* <li>P is the proportion infested </li>
* <li>max is the maximum infestation rate </li>
* <li>T is the time since the start of the infestation, in years</li>
* <li>a is a parameter</li>
* <li>b is calculated, as below</li>
* </ul>
*
* b is calculated as follows:
*
* b = bx * BA + by
*
* where BA is the proportion of basal area comprised of trees to which this
* behavior has been assigned (0 - 1).
*
* This behavior allows for the possibility that there are various levels of
* resistance in the tree population. Users can assign a percentage of trees
* that are "resistant" or "conditionally susceptible". This behavior will not
* infest "resistant" trees but otherwise does nothing with this information -
* other behaviors are planned that take advantage of this.
*
* All species are treated as a common pool and there are no species-specific
* parameters for infestation. There are species-specific parameters for the
* rates of resistance and conditional susceptibility.
*
* The proportion of trees infested at time T does not depend on additions to or
* subtractions from the tree population.  The number of trees of a species at
* that time is counted and the number of trees that are newly infested is the
* number required to cause the appropriate proportion to be infested.  If for
* some reason there are more trees infested than there should be at that time,
* no additional trees are infested.
*
* Susceptible individuals come in two size classes, with the cutoff DBH set as
* a parameter. All the individuals above this DBH are infected before any below
* the cutoff are. Note that when max < 1, it is possible that no individuals
* below the DBH cutoff will ever be infected.
*
* There is no spatial component to the selection of trees for infestation. It is
* assumed that all trees have an equal chance of becoming infested no matter
* where they are in the plot. The number of trees that should be infested for a
* given time step minus the number that actually are gives the probability that
* an uninfested tree will become infested this time step. A random number is
* used against this probability for each uninfested tree to determine whether or
* not it will become infested.
*
* Infestation begins at a year specified by the user. This can be negative,
* indicating that the infestation began before the beginning of the run. In
* this case, the behavior setup before the run will include the step of
* determining the number of infested initial conditions trees and their length
* of infestation.
*
* Two integer data member is added to trees. The first is called "YearsInfested"
* and tracks the number of years that a tree has been infested. The second is
* called "DensDepResistanceStatus" and equals a value in the enum densDepResistanceStatus
* in DataTypes.h.
*
* This behavior will not infest trees below a minimum DBH set by the user.
* Because of the need for DBH, obviously seedlings are ignored.
*
* This behavior's call string and name string are both "DensDepInfestation".
