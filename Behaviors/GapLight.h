/**
* Gap Light - Version 1.0
*
* This behavior simplifies GLI calculations by treating GLI as binary:  either
* an area is in gap, and GLI = 100% (full sun), or an area is not in gap, and
* GLI = 0% (no sun).
*
* This behavior uses a grid object, called "Gap Light", to help it assign GLI
* values to the trees to which it is assigned.  The presence of an adult tree
* in a cell of "Gap Light" causes that cell's status to be non-gap.  The
* absence of any adult trees in a cell causes it to be gap.  For all trees to
* which this behavior is assigned, if they are in a gap cell, their GLI is set
* to 100%; otherwise it is 0%.
*
* The namestring is "gaplightshell".  The parameter file call string is
* "GapLight".
