/**
* Storm Damage Applier - Version 1.1
*
* The damage applier manages the population of trees that are storm-damaged.
* It adds new trees to the damaged population after storms have occurred, and
* removes trees from the damaged population (back to the healthy population)
* by keeping track of the time they have been damaged until a maximum has been
* reached.  This behavior also keeps track of the damage category into which
* each tree falls (no damage, medium damage, and heavy damage).
*
* Whether storms have occurred is assessed by clStorm.  This behavior uses the
* values in the "Storm Damage" grid for storm severity, with 0 meaning that
* no storm has occurred.
*
* A given tree's probability of damage in a given damage category is
* <center><i>P(i) = exp(a<sub>i</sub> + b*c*DBH^d) / (1+exp(a<sub>i</sub> +
* b*c*DBH^d))</i></center>
* where:
* <ul>
* <li>i is the damage category</li>
* <li><i>a<sub>i</sub></i> is the storm damage intercept for that tree's
* species for that damage category</li>
* <li><i>b</i> is the storm intensity coefficient for that tree's species</li>
* <li><i>c</i> is the storm damage index between 0 and 1, which comes from the
* tree's grid cell in "Storm Damage"</li>
* <li><i>DBH</i> is the tree's DBH, in cm</li>
* <li><i>d</i> is the storm DBH coefficient for that tree's species</li>
* </ul>
*
* There is a minimum DBH for which to apply storms for each species.  Set this
* to zero if storms apply to all trees.
*
* This behavior will use a random number to determine what damage category a
* tree falls in.  If rand <= P(d0), it's undamaged.  If P(d0) < rand <= P(d1),
* it has medium damage.  If P(d1) < rand <= 1, it has heavy damage.
*
* If a tree is damaged, a flag is set with the damage category. Then a counter
* is set to count the time since damage.  When the counter reaches the number
* of years that it takes a damaged tree to heal, the tree is undamaged once
* again.
*
* If a live tree is already damaged and is damaged again (and survives again),
* it gets the most severe damage category that can apply to it and the damage
* counter is reset to the max time for tree healing again.
*
* This behavior adds one tree data member:  an int, "stm_dmg", which holds both
* the damage category and the amount of time left to heal.  The possible damage
* category values are 0, 1, and 2 (no damage, medium damage, full damage).  The
* value in stm_dmg will be x*1000 + count, where x is the damage category and
* count is the number of years since damage.  So a full-damaged tree with 5
* years on its counter has a stm_dmg value of 2005, and a medium-damaged tree
* with 8 years on its counter has a stm_dmg value of 1008.  If a tree is
* undamaged, the value will be 0.
*
* This behavior cannot be applied to seedlings.  It can be applied to snags but
* they will be ignored.  This is potentially a good tactic though, to allow
* clStormKiller to deal with snags.
*
* The call string for this is "StormDamageApplier".
