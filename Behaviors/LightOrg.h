/**
* Light org - Version 1.0
*
* This class does the organizational work for getting trees their light values
* for a timestep.  It hooks into a light shell object and is triggered by that
* object when it is triggered by the behavior manager.
*
* All light objects require a tree float data member called "Light", which this
* object will register for them.
*
* An object of this class will then call each tree and direct it to the
* appropriate light shell object function for calculation of its light value.
*
* This class has a core job for those light objects that apply to trees.
* However, there are many behaviors which don't calculate tree light levels in
* the traditional sense but calculate light levels for other purposes and are
* descended from the clLightBase class.  This class can still perform useful
* services for them, such as keeping the common light parameters.
*
* A fatal error will be thrown if the number of years per timestep in the
* sim manager is not an integer.  This is less a calculations problem than a
* conceptual one; these light behaviors cannot handle partial growing seasons
* and it would be a shame not to alert someone to that.
