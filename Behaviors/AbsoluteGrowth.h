/**
* Absolute growth with suppression
*
* This is a growth shell object which applies the Michaelis-Menton function to
* find absolute growth with suppression and release dynamics.
*
* The growth equation is Y = SF * (A * gli) / ((A/S) + gli), where Y is the
* log10 of new radial growth in mm/yr, SF is the suppression factor,
* A is asymptotic diameter growth, GLI is global light index, and S is the
* slope of growth response.  Growth can be limited to a radial increment or an
* area increment, or unlimited.  An object of this class can support either
* diameter-only updating or diameter updating with automatic height adjustment.
*
* Suppression is calculated as SF = e<sup>(g*YLR - d*YLS)</sup>, where g is
* the value in mp_fLengthCurrReleaseFactor, d is the value in
* mp_fLengthLastSuppFactor, YLR is the years of the last (or current) release
* period, and YLS is the years of the last (or current) suppression period.
*
* An object of this class can be created in several ways.  Use the strings
* "AbsRadialGrowth", "AbsBAGrowth", and "AbsUnlimGrowth" to create behaviors
* that calculate a diameter increase with automatic height adjustment. These
* strings represent absolute growth limited by constant radial increment,
* absolute growth limited by constant basal area increment, and unlimited
* absolute growth, respectively. Add the string " diam only" (example -
* "AbsBAGrowth diam only") to tell this behavior that only the tree's diameter,
* and not its height, should be updated.
*
* The namestring for this class is "absolutegrowthshell".  It is probable that
* there will be more than one object of this class created.
*
* This object will add two int data members to the applicable trees, "ycr"
* and "yls" (for years of current release and years of last suppression).
