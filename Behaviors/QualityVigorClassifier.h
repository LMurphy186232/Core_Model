/**
 * Quality Vigor Classifier version 1.0
 * Manages tree classification based on stem vigor, species classification, and
 * quality.
 *
 * <b>Assigning a classification</b><br/>
 * The possible states of "species type" are deciduous and coniferous. The
 * possible states of "vigor" are vigorous and not vigorous. The possible states
 * of "quality" are sawlog potential and no sawlog potential.
 *
 * Only adults can be assigned a class number.

 *
 * <b>Assigning a vigor and quality to new adults</b><br/>
 * For each species, there is a probability that a new adult of that species is
 * vigorous, and for deciduous species, that it is sawlog quality. A random
 * number is compared to these values to determine the vigor and quality of a
 * new adult tree. Classification can then proceed according to the table above.
 *
 * <b>Initial conditions</b><br/>
 * Trees may come in with a class already assigned in a tree map. If not, the
 * user can specify the proportion of trees vigorous and sawlog in various size
 * classes. Any trees not covered by one of the two previous assignment methods
 * will be assigned based on the new adult proportions.
 *
 * <b>Changes in vigor and quality</b><br/>
 * The probability of transition between vigor states and quality states is
 * calculated with the same functional form (but different parameters). The
 * probability of being vigorous or of being of sawlog quality is:
 *
 * @htmlonly
  <center>prob= exp(&beta;X)/(1+exp(&beta;X))</center>
   @endhtmlonly where:

   @htmlonly
   <center>&beta;X= &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1init</sub> +
   &beta;<sub>2sp</sub>*DBH + &beta;<sub>3sp</sub>*ln(DBH)</center>
   @endhtmlonly
 *
 * where &beta;<sub>1init</sub> is a beta for the initial state.
 *
 * This behavior adds three tree data members: two booleans, "vigorous" and
 * "sawlog", and one int called "treeclass" with a possible value from 1-6.
 *
 * This behavior can only be applied to adult trees.
 *
 * The namestring and parameter file call string are "QualityVigorClassifier".
