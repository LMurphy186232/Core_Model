/**
 * Non-spatial disperse - Version 1.0
 *
 * This class performs non-spatial dispersal. There are two kinds. The first is
 * non-density dependent, or bath, dispersal.  This kind of dispersal
 * represents a constant seed rain which does not depend on the presence of
 * parent trees in the plot.  The other kind is density-dependent dispersal.
 * The number of seeds produced depends on the amount of basal area of
 * reproductively mature trees of that species in the plot.
 *
 * The mean number of seeds per square meter per year is calculated as
 * lambda = BA*m + b, where m is the slope of lambda, b is the intercept of
 * lambda, and BA is the amount of basal area in square meters per hectare.
 * Lambda is multiplied by number of square meters per seed grid cell and number
 * of years per timestep to arrive at the expected number of seeds per grid
 * cell.
 *
 * The slope of lambda controls density-dependent dispersal.  Setting it equal
 * to zero turns off density-dependent dispersal.  The intercept of lambda
 * controls non-density dependent dispersal, and same thing goes there.
 *
 * This behavior is not connected to any specific species-type combo, but is
 * connected to specific species.  There should be applyTo tags for this
 * behavior and a unique list of species will be compiled for those tags with
 * the type being ignored.
 *
 * This behavior's namestring and parameter file call string are both
 * "NonSpatialDisperse".
