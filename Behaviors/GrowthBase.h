/**
* Base class for behaviors that implement tree growth.  Tree growth is the
* change of a tree's diameter and/or height.  (The normal method is to increase
* these dimensions.  This class has not been tested with code that causes
* trees to shrink.)
*
* There are two ways to change a tree's size.  The first method is to
* increment the tree's diameter, and allow the tree population to automatically
* change the height to match.  The second method is to increment the diameter
* and height separately and explicitly, and override the tree population's
* auto-update of the other dimension.  This base class can accommodate child
* classes that use either method.  Each object of each child class is
* responsible for figuring out how the user intends it to work and setting the
* appropriate flags, especially if it can work by either method.
*
* Sometimes growth behaviors need to make calculations before any DBHs have
* been incremented; for instance, neighborhood competition growth behaviors
* need to be assured that no trees have been changed when performing these
* calculations.  If a growth behavior has to make these sorts of calculations,
* it can override the PreGrowthCalcs() function.
*
* Classes descended from this class are referred to as shell classes.  (That's
* my term - there's probably a better one.)  This is because these child
* classes don't function as standalone behaviors, but leave the organizational
* work to another class (clGrowthOrg).  The clGrowthOrg class coordinates the
* efforts of all objects of the shell classes for maximum efficiency.
*
* Since clGrowthOrg is not descended from clBehaviorBase, it doesn't receive
* the triggers from the simulation manager that tell it when to work (calls to
* GetData(), Action(), etc).  So, one shell object (any one, it doesn't matter
* which) is "hooked" to clGrowthOrg.  When it receives the triggers from
* clSimManager, it passes them on to clGrowthOrg for processing.  All other
* shells ignore these triggers, since they receive their instructions from
* clGrowthOrg.
*
* Every object made from this class or a descendent class must have the string
* "growthshell" in its namestring somewhere, to identify it as a shell object.
*
* This base class also declares a new tree float data member on behalf of each
* child shell object; the growth org object then registers it.  The descendents
* don't need to do anything. The new data member is called "Growth", and will
* store the amount of diameter growth in mm/yr calculated.
*
* You cannot create an object that is an instance of this class, although you
* can certainly cast pointers to instances of child classes to be of type
* clGrowthBase if needed.
