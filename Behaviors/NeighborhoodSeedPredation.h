/**
* Neighborhood Seed Predationon - version 1.1
*
* This behavior reduces the number of seeds by simulating seed predation. Rate
* of offtake is a function of neighborhood composition.
*
* This can be used in two forms. In the standalone form, masting is also used to
* determine offtake. In the linked form, the clFuncResponseSeedPredation class
* determines the offtake rate, and this class figures out where seeds get eaten.
* In this case, masting is ignored.
*
* In the standalone version, there are two choices for assessing masting: in the
* first, masting is assessed by counting the seeds to which this behavior
* applies and which participate in masting (two different things - the latter is
* controlled by a boolean parameter ) and comparing it to a density per timestep
* threshold. Above the threshold is masting; below is not. The second choice
* is to ask the masting disperse behaviors if any species has masted; if any
* have, then it is a masting event. (If masting disperse behaviors are not
* used, then masting never occurs.)  The only difference between masting and
* non-masting timesteps is the parameters used.
*
* For both versions, the proportion of seed removed is calculated as:
* @htmlonly
  <br><center>logit(Y) = p<sub>0</sub> + &Sigma; p<sub>n</sub> * RBA <sub>n</sub></center>
  @endhtmlonly
* where, summing over the species from n = 1...N, p<sub>n</sub> is the loading
* factor for species n, and RBA<sub>n</sub> is the relative basal area of
* species n. There is a species specific minimum DBH for neighbors to include.
*
* In the standalone version, this is used directly as the amount of seed
* removed. In the linked version, it is used to distribute the offtake rate
* from the functional response seed predation behavior. Conceptually, the
* local offtake rate is adjusted by a correction factor, calculated by dividing
* the FR offtake Z by the mean off the local offtakes, so the plot-level offtake
* remains the same. Mathematically it is a little more complicated:
* <ol>
* <li>Calculate logit(Z)</li>
* <li>Calculate the logit(Ys) and subtract the minimum value from each (as well
* as the logit(Z)) so they will all be positive</li>
* <li>Average the logit(Y)s</li>
* <li>Divide logit(Z) by average logit(Y) to get a correction factor</li>
* <li>Multiply each logit(Y) by the correction factor</li>
* <li>Add back the same minimum value formerly subtracted</li>
* <li>Backtransform logit(Y) to Y and use when removing seeds</li>
* </ol>
*
* A fatal error is thrown if a disperse behavior is not also defined for the
* run, and additionally if this is linked and the clFuncResponseSeedPredation
* class is missing.
*
* This class's namestring is "NeighborhoodSeedPredation". If standalone, the
* parameter call string is "NeighborhoodSeedPredation". If linked, the
* parameter call string is "LinkedNeighborhoodSeedPredation".
