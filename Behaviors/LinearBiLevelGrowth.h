/**
* Increments growth according to a simple linear equation, with the possibility
* of two sets of parameters for each species.  The two sets of parameters can
* be used for two different growth rates at high and low light.  This behavior
* can be used to create a growth increment with no automatic height adjustment
* or a growth increment with automatic height adjustment.
*
* The equation used in this behavior is:
* <center>Y = a + b * diam</center>
* where
* <ul>
* <li>Y = diameter growth in cm/year</li>
* <li>a = growth intercept</li>
* <li>b = growth slope</li>
* <li>diam = diam10 for seedlings and saplings, or DBH for adults</li>
* </ul>
*
* This behavior can also take into account light levels coming from the "Storm
* Light" grid object produced by clStormLight.  This behavior can use two
* different sets of parameter values - one at low light and one at high light.
* The user sets the threshold between the two.  The equation remains the same.
*
* The name string is "linearbilevelgrowthshell".  In the parameter file:  For
* diameter growth with no automatic height adjustment, call
* "LinearBilevelGrowth diam only".  For diameter growth with automatic height
* adjustment, call "LinearBilevelGrowth".
