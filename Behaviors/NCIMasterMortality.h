/**
* NCI Mortality - Version 3.0
*
* This is a mortality shell object which applies an NCI (neighborhood
* competition index) function to assess probability of survival. The basic
* function is a maximum rate of survival that is reduced by a set of
* multiplicative effects. The set of effects used is up to the user.
*
* The annual survival probability is compounded for multi-year timesteps by
* taking it to the X power, where X is the number of years per timestep.
*
* The namestring for this class is "ncimortshell". The parameter file call
* string is "NCIMortality".
*
* This behavior can only be applied to saplings and adults.
