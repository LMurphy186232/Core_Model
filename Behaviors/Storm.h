/**
* Storms version 3.0.
* The storm damage calculator's function is to assess whether or not one or
* more storms has occurred, and if so, what the damage pattern and amount of
* damage were. It creates a map of storm damage across the plot, with each
* location getting a damage index between 0 (no damage) and 1 (most damage).
*
* <b>Deciding when storms occur</b><br>
* The 0 - 1 interval of storm severity values is subdivided into ten storm
* severity classes. Each class is assigned a return interval in the parameter
* file by the user. Taking the reciprocal of the return interval gives us the
* annual probability of each type of storm.
*
* To decide whether a given storm occurs, a random number is compared to the
* annual probability. Each storm severity class is decided individually.
* For multi-year timesteps, there is one random "coin flip" per year per
* severity class. This allows multiple storms to occur in the same timestep.
* For multi-year timesteps, multiple storms of the same severity class can
* occur, up to one per year. Each storm event creates a separate record in the
* storm damage grid. Storm severity is bounded between 0 and 1.
*
* The frequency of storms can optionally be cyclical (sinusoidal), with an
* optional overall trend. The actual probability of any storm that uses
* a cyclical storm regime is:
*
* <center>P'(Fi) = P(Fi) * ([d*sin(pi(x-g)/(2f))] + [mx + i])</center>
* where:
* <ul>
* <li>P'(Fi) = this timestep's probability of a storm of the ith return
* interval</li>
* <li>P(Fi) = the baseline (parameter file) probability of a storm of the ith
* return interval; that is, 1 / return interval</li>
* <li>The first term represents the sinusoidal portion</li>
* <li>The second term represents the trend portion</li>
* <li>x = 4*(t-t0)/Sr, where t = timestep since storms started, t0 = cycle
* start point, and Sr = sine periodicity parameter</li>
* <li>d is a parameter that controls the sine curve's amplitude</li>
* <li>f is a parameter that controls the sine curve's frequency</li>
* <li>g is a parameter that controls where on the curve we are when storms
* start occuring</li>
* <li>m is a parameter that gives the trend line's slope</li>
* <li>i is a parameter that gives the trend line's intercept</li>
* </ul>
*
* Storm events can also be specifically scheduled. In this case, they will
* occur in addition to any background storms. The user supplies a minimum and
* a maximum value for the storm intensity and a timestep.
*
* <b>Calculating damage when storms occur</b><br>
* The amount of damage caused by a timestep's storms is stored in the grid
* named "Storm Damage".  Each cell in the grid can contain 0 or more packages.
* 0 packages indicates no storm occurred. There is one package for each storm
* that occurred that timestep, with a single value between 0 (no damage) and 1
* (total damage).  In addition, a counter is set containing the
* number of years since the last storm.
*
* There are four damage patterns, and the value in the "Storm Damage" cells
* is calculated differently for each:
* <ol>
* <li><i>Varying spatial distribution, deterministic.</i>  In this pattern, a
* static storm vulnerability map is supplied for the plot in the parameter
* file.  The map is a set of values from 0 (no susceptibility) on up.  The
* susceptibility value at a location is multiplied by the damage index of any
* storm that hits to arrive at a final damage index for that location.</li>
* <li><i>Varying spatial distribution, stochastic.</i>  In this pattern, a
* static storm vulnerability map is supplied for the plot in the parameter
* file.  The map is a set of values from 0 (no susceptibility) to 1 (maximum
* susceptibility).  The damage index of a storm is determined as for the
* "Uniform stochastic" method.  Then the susceptibility value at a location is
* multiplied by this damage index to arrive at a final damage index for that
* location.</li>
* <li><i>Uniform deterministic.</i>  All plot locations receive the storm's
* designated damage index.</li>
* <li><i>Uniform stochastic.</i>  The storm's designated severity is used as the
* mean in a probability distribution function to arrive at a final damage
* index.</li>
* </ol>
*
* This behavior's call string and name string are both "Storm".
