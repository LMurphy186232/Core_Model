/**
* Post-Harvest Skidding Mortality - Version 1.0
*
* This evaluates mortality as a function of time since the last harvest,
* harvest intensity, DBH, and local basal area. If harvesting has not occurred,
* then a constant background mortality rate is applied.
*
* This class's namestring is "PostHarvestSkiddingMortshell". Its parameter
* file call string is "PostHarvestSkiddingMortality".
