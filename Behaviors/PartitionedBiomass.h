/**
* Partitioned Biomass Calculator Version 1.0
*
* This behavior calculates biomass, partitioned by tree part.  This has two
* possible equations for calculating biomass:  one as a linear function of DBH,
* and one as a linear function of height.  If the DBH equation is used, then
* biomass is partitioned into branches, leaf, and bole. If the height equation
* is used, it is partitioned into leaf and bole only (as for palms).
*
* The equations are:
* <center>Bio<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub> * DBH + b<sub>i</sub></center>
* <center>Bio<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub> * DBH + b<sub>i</sub></center>
*
* for the ith component (leaf, branch, etc).  Biomass values are not allowed to
* be 0.  Any negative values are set to zero.
*
* The values are collected into a grid called "Partitioned Biomass".
*
* This class's namestring is "PartitionedBiomass."  If using with DBH, the
* parameter file call string is "PartitionedDBHBiomass".  If using with
* Height, the parameter file call string is "PartitionedHeightBiomass".
*
* This behavior may not be applied to seedlings.
