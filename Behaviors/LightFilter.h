/**
* Implements a light filter according to Beer's Law.  Imagine a fog that hangs
* out on the forest floor and ends abruptly at a certain height.  All trees
* shorter than the top of the fog layer will have their light attenuated but
* not blocked completely.  The closer they get to the top of the fog the more
* light is let in.  The amount of light which actually gets through is
* calculated according to Beer's Law, where %transmission = e<sup>-az</sup>,
* where a = light extinction coefficient of the filter (in 1/meter units,
* somehow) and z = thickness of the filter, in meters (which is the distance
* from the light point to the top of the filter).  This filter behavior can be
* used to, for instance, replicate the effects of an herbaceous layer in
* reducing light to young seedlings.
*
* The height of the filter is randomized slightly each time the
* thickness of the filter over the light point is calculated to introduce a
* stochastic element.
*
* Trees can be given a respite from the effects of the filter.  This behavior
* will create an integer tree data member for a counter for years of respite
* (called "lf_count").  This behavior doesn't set the value in the counter;
* that is left to another behavior, such as recruitment.  Once a counter is set,
* this behavior will decrement it until it is zero, leaving the tree alone for
* the duration.
*
* Trees are given a rooting height (integer tree data member, in mm, called
* "z", added by this behavior).  This value is added to their existing height to
* get their effective height, which is what will be applied when determining
* the thickness of the filter overhead.  Again, this behavior does not set this
* height but will use it if another behavior sets it.
*
* This behavior DOES NOT ACTUALLY CALCULATE LIGHT LEVELS.  It will check all
* tree types to which it is applied to ensure that a float data member called
* "Light" has been registerd.  This data member is assumed to contain a GLI-like
* value, which is reduced by the percent transmission calculated.  A fatal
* error will be thrown if this data member has not been registered during
* setup.
*
* This behavior only affects tree types and species to which it is applied in
* the behavior list of the parameter file.  It will ignore all other trees,
* even if they are short enough to be beneath the filter level.
*
* Units are kept in integer number of millimeters, where possible, to increase
* the amount of integer math (fast) and decrease the amount of float math
* (slow).
*
* The namestring for this behavior is "LightFilter".  Call this behavior in
* the parameter file with the string "LightFilter".
