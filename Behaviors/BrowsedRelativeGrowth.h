/**
* Browsed relative Michaelis-Menton growth - Version 1.0
*
* This is a growth shell object which applies the Michaelis-Menton function to
* find relative growth. There are two growth rates: one for browsed, and one
* for unbrowsed.
*
* Browsedness is determined by the Random Browse behavior (class
* clRandomBrowse). This class expects that behavior to be enabled and the
* "Browsed" bool data member to be present for all trees to which this behavior
* is applied.
*
* The growth equation is:
* <center><i>Y = (A * gli) / ((A/S) + gli)</i></center>
* where Y is the relative annual radial growth, A is asymptotic diameter
* growth, gli is the amount of light, and S is the slope of growth response.
*
* The actual amount of new growth is:
* <center><i>G = ((Y + 1)<sup>T</sup> - 1) * diam<sup>Q</sup></i></center>
* where Y is from the equation above, T is the number of years per timestep,
* diam is the tree's diameter, and Q is the diameter exponent.
*
* (There are some strangenesses in the math - 1s are added and subtracted at
* various times and I don't know why.  This is based on code I didn't
* originally write.)
*
* The namestring for this class is "browsedrelgrowthshell".  Call in the
* parameter file via "BrowsedRelativeGrowth" or "BrowsedRelativeGrowth
* diam only".
