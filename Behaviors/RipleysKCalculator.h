/**
* Ripley's K Calculator Version 1.0
*
* This behavior calculates Ripley's K. Ripley's K is calculated for successive
* distances out to a maximum. The user sets the maximum distance and the
* increment. Ripley's K for a given distance t is calculated as:
*
* @htmlonly K(t) = AX / n<sup>2</sup>@endhtmlonly
*
* where A is the area of the plot in square meters, X is the number of pairs of
* trees <= t meters apart, and n is the total number of trees in the plot. All
* saplings and adults are counted. All other types are ignored.
*
* When searching for tree pairs it is important to make sure we only find each
* pair a single time. So the search proceeds by tree population grid cell. For
* each cell, a square of cells around it is searched. A matrix is used to keep
* track of which cells have already been paired so they are not paired again.
*
* The statistic is calculated both for all trees and for individual species.
*
* The values are collected into a grid called "Ripley's K".
*
* This class's namestring and parameter file call string are "RipleysK". Any
* tree type/species assignments are ignored.
