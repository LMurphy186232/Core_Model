/**
* Bole Volume Calculator Version 1.0
*
* This class calculates merchantable tree volume according to a US Forest
* Service equation. The volume value is stored in an float tree data member
* that this behavior adds as a value in cubic feet.
*
* Tree volume is calculated as follows:
*
* <center>V = b0 + b1*DBH<sup>b2</sup> + b3* DBH<sup>b4</sup> * Height<sup>b5</sup></center>
*
* Where:
* <ul>
* <li>V = gross cubic foot volume</li>
* <li>Height = bole length in feet, as a multiple of 16 (for usable 16-foot
* logs)</li>
* <li>DBH = dbh in inches</li>
* <li>b0 - b5 are parameters</li>
* </ul>
*
* The bole length is the number of 16-foot logs the tree can provide.  The base
* of the bole is the top of the cut stump (whatever that is; it's ignored by
* this behavior); the top of the bole is the merchantable height.  This
* behavior defines the merchantable height as the height at which the trunk
* diameter inside the bark tapers to 60% of DBH.
*
* To determine at what bole length the merchantable height occurs, we try
* fitting as many 16-foot logs as possible in to see how many fit before the
* 60% taper occurs.  The amount of taper at the top of the first 16-foot log is
* established by the form classes and is a fixed percentage entered by the user
* as a parameter.
*
* The amount of taper at the top of the first 16-foot log is subtracted from
* the DBH, to see how much taper is left before the 60% merchantable-height
* taper is reached.  There is no formula that establishes clearly how many logs
* will fit; we use a trial-and-error approach on a table until we find the
* correct number of logs.  The table below, adapted from Messavage and Girard,
* is contained in the code.  It represents the amount of taper at the top of
* the last log in a tree containing different numbers of logs.
* <table border=1>
* <tr><th>DBH (in)</th><th>2-log</th><th>3-log</th><th>4-log</th><th>5-log</th><th>6-log</th></tr>

*
* Consider a maple tree with a 20-inch DBH.  The user enters its form class as
* 79%.  We calculate the merchantable height to be that height at which the
* tree diameter inside the bark is 20 * 0.6 = 12 inches.  The diameter at the
* top of the first 16-foot log = 20 * 0.79 = 15.8 inches.
*
* The diameter at merchantable height is 12 inches; at the top of the first
* log it is 15.8 inches.  This means there is 3.8 inches of taper available
* left.  The next job is to use the lookup table to determine how many logs
* will fit into this amount of taper.
*
* Our DBH is 20 inches, which has an entry for itself in the lookup table.  If
* our DBH was not an even multiple of 2 inches, we would round down to the next
* lowest multiple of 2.  Any tree larger than 40 inches of DBH will use the
* 40-inch entry.  Trees must have a DBH of at least 10 inches to get a volume.
*
* We begin by assuming that our tree is a 2-log tree.  The amount of taper to
* the top of the second log in the table is given as 2.1.  This means our
* diameter at the top of the second log is 15.8 - 2.1 = 13.7 inches.  This is
* greater than 12 inches; so we will go back and try to fit three logs in.
*
* For a 3-log tree of 20 inches, the taper at the top of the third log is 3.6
* inches.  The diameter at the top of this log is 15.8 - 3.6 = 12.2.  This is
* still greater than 12, so we will try to fit in  four logs.
*
* The diameter at the top of the fourth log of a 4-log tree of 20 inches DBH
* is 15.8 - 1.4 - 1.8 - 2.4, or  10.2.  This is less than 12.  Thus, 4 logs
* don't fit.  Our bole length is 3 * 16 = 48 feet.
*
* This behavior adds an float data member called "Bole Vol" to trees that holds
* the final volume calculation as a value in square meters.
*
* This class's namestring and parameter call string are both
* "TreeBoleVolumeCalculator".
*
* This behavior may not be applied to seedlings.
