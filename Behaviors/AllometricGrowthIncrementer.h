/**
* Calculates a growth increment based on allometry. This is designed to be a
* secondary growth method for height or diameter when the growth method for the
* other dimension is the primary one.
*
* If this is acting as a height increment, the increment is calculated as:
* <br><center>inc = f(DIAM<sub>a</sub>) - f(DIAM<sub>b</sub>)</center>
* <br>where inc is the height increment, f(x) is the height as a function
* of diameter allometry equation appropriate for the tree type,
* DIAM<sub>a</sub> is the tree's diameter before the growth increment is
* applied, and DIAM<sub>b</sub> is the tree's diameter after the growth
* increment is applied.  The tree height cannot be greater than the maximum
* tree height for a species. If the tree type is seedling, DIAM is diameter at
* 10 cm.  Otherwise, it's DBH.
*
* If this is acting as a diameter increment, the increment is calculated as:
* <br><center>inc = f(H<sub>a</sub>) - f(H<sub>b</sub>)</center>
* <br>where inc is the diameter increment, f(x) is the height as a function
* of diameter allometry equation appropriate for the tree type,
* H<sub>a</sub> is the tree's diameter before the growth increment is
* applied, and H<sub>b</sub> is the tree's diameter after the growth
* increment is applied.
*
* When calculating an increment, the same allometric equation is used for both
* portions, even if the tree would be making a type transition.  For example,
* if the tree is a seedling and the amount of diameter growth is enough to make
* it into a sapling, the seedling diam10-height relationship is still used for
* both values.
*
* The parameter file call string for this behavior is either "HeightIncrementer"
* or "DiameterIncrementer".  The namestring is "allometric incrementer
* growthshell".

  * Calculates the amount of height growth increase for a particular tree.

  *
  * If the tree is a seedling, the diam10 before and after the growth increment

  * a DBH value and that value is used in the sapling DBH-height allometric
  * equation.  If the tree is an adult, then DBH before and after the growth
  * increment is used in the adult DBH-height allometric equation.
  *
  * This doesn't need to compound height by timestep length, since diameter
  * should already take that into account.
