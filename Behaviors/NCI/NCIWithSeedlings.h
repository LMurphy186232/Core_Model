/**
 * Calculates NCI and allows seedlings to compete.
 *
 * NCI<sub>i</sub> is calculated as follows (simplifying the notation):
 * @htmlonly
  <center><i>NCI<sub>i</sub> = &Sigma; &lambda;<sub>k</sub>((d10<sub>k</sub>/q)<sup>&alpha;</sup>/distance<sup>&beta;</sup>)</i></center>

  where:
  <ul>
  <li>we're summing over k = 0 to N neighbors greater than the minimum
  neighbor DBH</li>
  <li><i>&alpha;</i> is the neighbor DBH effect parameter</li>
  <li><i>&beta;</i> is the neighbor distance effect parameter</li>
  <li><i>q</i> is the DBH divisor parameter</li>
  <li><i>d10<sub>k</sub></i> is the diameter of the kth neighbor, in cm</li>
  <li><i>&gamma;</i> is the size sensitivity to NCI parameter</li>
  <li><i>&lambda;<sub>k</sub></i> is the NCI lambda parameter for the species
  of the kth neighbor</li>
  <li><i>distance</i> is distance from target to neighbor, in meters</li>
  </ul>

 * Seedlings are allowed to compete as neighbors.
 *
 * NCI ignores neighbors with disturbance and harvest death codes. Natural deaths
 * are NOT ignored, because it presumes that those deaths occurred in the current
 * timestep and they should still be considered as live neighbors.
 *
 * This returns 1 value for NCI.
