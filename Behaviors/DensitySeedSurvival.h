/**
* Density-Dependent Seed Survival - version 2.0
*
* This behavior reduces the number of seeds due to conspecific density-dependent
* effects. The "density" in question can be either other seeds, or trees in
* the neighborhood.
*
* The number of seeds this behavior leaves of a given species in a particular
* "Dispersed Seeds" grid cell is:
* @htmlonly
  <br><center>R<sub>sp</sub> = S<sub>sp</sub>*exp(-c*Den<sub>sp</sub><sup>&delta;</sup>)</center><br>
  @endhtmlonly
  where:</p>
* <ul>
* <li>R<sub>sp</sub> is the number of seedlings of a given species in the seed
* grid cell (competition is conspecific only)</li>
* <li>S<sub>sp</sub> is the potential number of seedlings of the species, i.e.
* the number of seeds dispersed to that grid cell.</li>
* <li>Den<sub>sp</sub> is either:
* <ul>
*   <li>The density of seed of the species per square meter in that grid cell;
*       or</li>
*   <li>The density of conspecific trees above a given height within a given
*       radius of the cell center, stems/m2.</li>
  </ul>
* <li>c is an input parameter - density-dependent slope</li>
* <li>@htmlonly &delta; @endhtmlonly is an input parameter - density-dependent
* steepness</li>
* </ul>
*
* Single seeds always survive, if using seeds-only density dependence.
*
* A fatal error is thrown if a disperse behavior is not also defined for the
* run.
*
* This class's namestring is "DensityDependentSeedSurvival". In the case of
* conspecific seed density, the parameter file call string is also
* "DensityDependentSeedSurvival"; in the case of conspecific tree neighbors,
* it's "ConspecificTreeDensityDependentSeedSurvival".
