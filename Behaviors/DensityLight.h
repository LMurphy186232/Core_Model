/**
* Density Light - Version 1.0
*
* This behavior calculates light level as a function of local tree density.
* The density is used to calculate a mean light level, which is used to choose
* a random value from a lognormal probability distribution.  In order to ensure
* some level of continuity through time, a grid cell's light level is not
* recalculated unless the local tree density has changed by at least an amount
* set by the user.
*
* A grid, "Density Light", is used to store light values.  Trees get the light
* levels of their grid cell.
*
* The mean light level for a grid cell is calculated as follows:
* <br><center><i>GLI<sub>m</sub> = a / (1 + (den/c) <sup>b</sup>)</i></center>
* where:
* <ul>
* <li><i>GLI<sub>m</sub></i> is the mean light level, as a value between 0 and
* 100</li>
* <li><i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are parameters</li>
* <li><i>den</i> is the number of trees in the "Density Light" cell (more on
* density calculations below)</li>
* </ul>
*
* When counting trees for the density, seedlings and snags are never counted.
* Other trees only count if they have a DBH above a user-set minimum.
*
* After the mean light level is calculated, it is turned into a "location
* parameter" (mu) for the lognormal PDF as follows:
* @htmlonly <center><i>&mu; = ln(mean) - (&sigma; <sup>2</sup>)/ 2</i></center> @endhtmlonly
*
* The mu value is used as the zeta value in a lognormal random draw.
*
* Note that this behavior is dependent on the size of grid cells for its
* behavior.
*
* This behavior creates a new grid called "Density Light".  There's more on
* that grid below.
*
* The namestring for this behavior is "densitylightshell"; the parameter file
* call string is "Density Light".
