/**
 * Temperature dependent neighborhood disperse - Version 1.0
 *
 * This class disperses seeds.  The number of seeds is a function of the plot
 * annual mean temperature and the basal area of conspecific adults.
 *
 * The number of seeds per square meter per year is calculated as:
 * Seeds = a + fec*BAC, where a is a parameter, and BAC is the basal area of
 * conspecific adults within a specified radius, in square meters.
 *
 * The "fec" term is fecundity, calculated as:
 * fec = fb*exp(-0.5*(((X-fm)/fn)^2)), where X is the plot annual mean
 * temperature and fb, fm, and fn are parameters.
 *
 * The number of seeds per square meter is multiplied by number
 * of square meters per seed grid cell and number of years per timestep to
 * arrive at the number of seeds per grid cell.
 *
 * The above equation includes an intercept term, which means there is the
 * possibility for bath rain of species for which there are no adults. A species
 * for which there are adults will always disperse. A species for which there
 * are no adults must undergo a "presence test". The site favorability for a
 * species is given by:
 * p = exp(-0.5*((X-pm)/pb)^2), where X is the plot annual mean
 * temperature and pb and pm are parameters. This function is bounded between 0
 * and 1. There is a parameter which is the presence threshold; if the result of
 * the function is above this value, the species is allowed to disperse.
 *
 * This behavior is not connected to any specific species-type combo, but is
 * connected to specific species.  There should be applyTo tags for this
 * behavior and a unique list of species will be compiled for those tags with
 * the type being ignored.
 *
 * This behavior's namestring and parameter file call string are both
 * "TemperatureDependentNeighborhoodDisperse".
