/**
* Increments growth according to a lognormal equation.  This can be used to
* create a growth increment with no automatic height adjustment, a growth
* increment with automatic height adjustment, or a height increment.
*
* The equation used in this behavior is:
* <center>Y = a * e<sup>(-0.5(ln(diam/36)/b)<sup>2</sup>)</sup>)*(GLI/100)<sup>c</sup></center>
* where
* <ul>
* <li>Y = either radial growth in mm/year or height growth in cm/yr
* <li>a = growth increment at diameter 36
* <li>b = Shape parameter
* <li>c = Effect of shade
* <li>diam = diameter of the tree at which to apply growth, in cm
* <li>GLI is global light index, from 0 to 100
* </ul>
*
* This behavior compounds this result for multi-year timesteps.  In the case
* of diameter growth, a copy of the diameter value is incremented X times (with
* X being the number of years per timestep) and the final increment is the sum
* of all the interim increments.  In the case of height growth, the amount of
* diameter growth is divided by X and this value used to increment height X
* times, with the nth diameter (n = 1 to X) being the original diameter plus
* (n * diameter growth / X).
*
* The name string is "lognormalgrowthshell". In the parameter file: For diameter
* growth with no automatic height adjustment, call "LognormalGrowth diam only".  For diameter growth with automatic height adjustment, call
* "LognormalGrowth".  For height growth, call "LognormalGrowth height only".
