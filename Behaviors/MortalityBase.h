/**
* Mortality base - Version 1.1
*
* This is the base class for mortality behavior shell classes.  These shells
* each evaluate different kinds mortality for a tree.
*
* The bulk of the organizational work is done by the class clMortalityOrg,
* which calls the needed shell functions for each tree.  The clMortalityOrg
* object hooks into one particular growth shell object, which calls
* clMortalityOrg when it is triggered by the behavior manager.  It does not
* particularly matter which shell object is hooked; the first one will suffice.
* Any non-hooked shells do nothing when their Action() and other functions are
* called.
*
* Every object made from this class or a descendent class must have the string
* "mortshell" in its namestring somewhere.

* <br>Edit history:
* <br>-----------------
* <br>April 28, 2004 - Submitted as beta (LEM)
* <br>April 29, 2004 - Updated to version 1.1 by adding a new mortality tree
*                      data member code for a death flag
* <br>July 21, 2004 - Fixed a bug in data member registrations (LEM)
* <br>April 5, 2005 - Added a pre-calculation stage for the sake of NCI (LEM)
* <br>February 8, 2008 - Changed mortality flags from simple booleans to reason
* codes (LEM)
