/**
* Lagged Post-Harvest Growth - Version 1.0
*
* This is a growth shell object that incorporates a lag period after
* harvest during which growth increases gradually to a higher value.
*
* Diameter growth of tree <i>i</i> before (<i>G<sub>pre</sub></i>) and well after
* harvest (<i>G<sub>post</sub></i>) is calculated as:
*
* @htmlonly
* <center>
* G<sub>pre/post</sub> = MG * exp(-p<sub>2</sub>NCI<sub>i</sub>)
* </center>
* Where Maximum growth (MG) is:
* <center>
* MG = p<sub>0</sub> * exp(-p<sub>1</sub> * dbh<sub>i</sub>)
* </center>
* and NCI<sub>i</sub> is:
*
* NCI<sub>i</sub> = (&Sigma;  BA<sub>n</sub>) * exp(-p<sub>3</sub>*dbh<sub>i</sub>)
* <ul>
* <li><i>dbh</i> is the diameter at breast height of the tree, in cm.
* <li><i>BA<sub>n</sub></i> is the basal area, in m<sup>2</sup>, of all adult trees within <i>d</i> m of the tree.
* </ul>
* @endhtmlonly
*
* Growth <i>YSH</i> years after harvest is calculated as:
*
* @htmlonly
* <center>
* G = G<sub>pre</sub> + (G<sub>post</sub> - G<sub>pre</sub>)*(1-exp(-p<sub>4</sub>*YSH))
* </center>
* @endhtmlonly
*
*
* The amount of growth is in cm/year.  For multi-year timesteps, the behavior
* will calculate total growth by multiplying by the number of years per timestep.
*
* This cannot be applied to seedlings.  An error will be thrown if seedlings
* are passed.
*
* This creates one new tree float data member called "PreHarvGr".
*
* This also creates a grid called "Years Since Last Harvest".
*
* The parameter file call string for this to be diameter-incrementing with
* auto-height updating is "LaggedPostHarvestGrowth"; for diameter-only
* incrementing, use "LaggedPostHarvestGrowth diam only".  The namestring for
* this behavior is "laggedpostharvestgrowthshell".
