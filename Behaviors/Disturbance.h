/**
* Disturbance - Version 2.1
*
* This class allows for highly specific disturbance events.  Two kinds of
* disturbance can be performed:  harvest or episodic mortality (disease,
* insect outbreaks, etc).  They work the exact same way, differing only in the
* reason code passed to the tree population when killing the tree (Harvest in
* the case of harvest, and disease in the case of episodic mortality).
*
* Harvest/mortality episodes can be defined on a grid cell level for each
* timestep for each species.  If more than one event is defined for a species
* for a single grid cell and timestep, the user takes a chance on what happens.
* Cells with common disturbance criteria are grouped by the user into groups
* which will be evaluated together.
*
* If the disturbance is harvest, there are three kinds of harvests that can be
* performed:  gap cut, partial cut, and clear cut.  Partial cuts may remove
* only a portion of the trees, but otherwise, there is no difference in how the
* trees are removed for each cut type.  The type of cut is recorded for the
* benefit of other behaviors for whom this might be important.  The user can
* define different ranges of dbh values to cut, and each can have a portion of
* the trees removed, as defined by percentage of basal area, percentage of
* density, absolute amount of basal area (in square meters per hectare), or
* absolute amount of density (in stems per hectare).  For gap cut and clear
* cut, for all species affected, all trees are removed.  Any attempt to define
* cut ranges etc. for gap and clear cuts will cause an error to be thrown (the
* cut ranges could be ignored but throwing an error alerts the user in case
* they didn't know, so they could amend the parameter file to get what they
* meant to get).
*
* Trees can be prioritized by any tree data member. Trees meeting the criterion
* will be cut before any others. There can be up to three priorities. The
* trees meeting each priority will be exhausted before moving to the next
* priority. If a priority does not apply to a tree or cut, it will be ignored.
* Prioritizing data members cannot be of type char. Priorities are not allowed
* in percent of density cut types because they would be nonsensical.
*
* Harvests can affect seedlings as well, by randomly killing a proportion of
* those found in the cut area. The kill rate is species specific and does not
* have to be the same as the species being harvested.
*
* Episodic mortality events are processed like harvest partial cuts.
*
* The disturbance event data is stored in a grid.  Each cut event, defined as
* the killing to be done for one species for one timestep for one grid cell,
* is stored in a grid package.  These packages are sorted in timestep order.
* Each timestep, all the cut events that are defined for that timestep are
* executed, then those packages are removed.
*
* Seedlings are always ignored by this behavior.
*
* This behavior can be called from the parameter file by either "Harvest" or
* "EpisodicMortality". The namestring is "harvest".

  /**
  * MASTER CUTS GRID
  *
  * If this behavior is harvesting, the grid is called "harvestmastercuts"; if
  * it is episodic mortality, the grid is called "mortepisodemastercuts".  The
  * grid has a single cell.  This is where the cut events are defined.
  *
  * Grid cell size defaults to match the tree population. A map is allowed only
  * to set cell size.
  *
  * Each cut event is one package and is applied to a list of species.  It has a
  * timestep, cut amount, cut type, and number of cut ranges defined.  It also
  * has a unique ID number.  The grid cells to which it is applied are in either
  * the "harvestcutevents" or "mortepisodecutevents" grid, depending on what
  * this behavior is.
  *
  * Species are treated individually.  A cut event removing 20% of three species
  * removes 20% of each species individually; one that removes 5 sq.m/ha of
  * basal area removes 5 from each species.
  *
  * For the cut ranges, four dbh ranges can be defined to which the cuts will be
  * applied.  The ranges are ordered as 1 is the smallest minimum dbh.  Ranges
  * cannot overlap.
  *
  * The packages are in timestep order, earliest first.
  *
  * It is possible that a grid map will have been read in for this grid; it will
  * be ignored, and any grid created with such a map will be overwritten.
