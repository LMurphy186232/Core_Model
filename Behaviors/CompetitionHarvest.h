/**
* Competition Based Harvest - Version 1.0
*
* This is a behavior which performs harvests by preferentially removing those
* trees that exert the most competitive pressure on their neighbors. This
* behavior is also more autonomous - it decides for itself when harvests occur
* and how much cutting to do based on criteria provided by the user.
*
* There are two ways to specify when harvests occur.
*
* 1)  Fixed basal area threshold. A harvest occurs every time the total plot
* basal area exceeds a threshold set by the user. There is a minimum interval
* between harvests which can be used to make sure they do not occur too
* frequently. The harvests cut either an absolute amount of basal area or a
* percentage of the total.
*
* 2)  Fixed interval. The user specifies how often harvests occur. The harvests
* cut the plot back to a set total basal area.
*
* Either way, the user can specify a minimum and maximum DBH for trees to
* harvest.
*
* Harvests may be species-specific or non-species-specific. If they are
* species-specific, the user specifies the relative amounts to remove of each
* species (including 0 for non-participating species). 100% participation for
* all species indicates that all species can be treated as a single group.
* Only participating species and size ranges are used to establish basal area
* criteria for initiating a harvest.
*
* The harvest preferentially removes the most competitive trees. The
* competitive effect (COE) of a tree i on neighbors j within a given radius is
* calculated as follows:
*
* @htmlonly
 <center><i>COE = exp(-C*DBH<sup>&gamma;</sup>*&lambda;*
 (DBH<sup>&alpha;</sup>/distance<sup>&beta;</sup>)<sup>D</sup>)</i></center>
  @endhtmlonly

* summed over all neighbors. The values of C, gamma, alpha, beta, and D are
* specific to the neighbor's species. Lambda is for the effect of the target
* species i on the neighbor species j. DBH is the neighbor's DBH, and distance
* is the distance in meters between the target and neighbor. Optionally, DBH
* can be divided by a divisor term if there needs to be a units correction.
*
* Trees in the plot are ranked by COE. The harvest behavior works its way down
* the list, removing trees in order, until the amount to harvest requirements
* have been met. After each tree is removed, the COE of all trees in its
* immediate vicinity are recalculated and the COE list will be resorted.
*
* If removing a tree will cause the harvest to overshoot its cutting target, a
* random number will be compared to the amount of overshoot to determine if the
* tree will be removed. Harvesting ends with this tree.
*
* If the cut is species-specific, a tree high on the competitiveness list will
* be skipped if a sufficient amount of that species has already been removed.
*
* The behavior uses a grid to report on actual harvest amounts removed across
* the plot, and optionally can provide a list of all individuals removed each
* timestep, along with their basal area, biomass and bole volume.
*
* Seedlings, snags, and dead trees have neither competitive effect on neighbors
* or have competitive effects put on them by other trees. In other words, they
* are always ignored.
*
* This adds one float data member to trees to which it is applied to hold their
* competitive effect. This member is called "COE". It has limited usefulness
* outside of this behavior.
*
* This behavior's namestring and parameter file call string are both
* "CompetitionHarvest".
