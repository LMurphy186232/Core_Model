/**
 * OBJECT MANAGER - Version 1.0
 *
 * This class is a virtual base class for the various types of object
 * managers - those which handle behaviors, populations, and grids. An object
 * manager controls all of the objects of a given type. It creates and destroys
 * them, triggers their management functions, and controls access to them. The
 * Simulation Manager directs the object managers so that they trigger the
 * correct functioning at the proper time within a run.
 *
 * This class should not be instantiated as an object but used only as a base
 * class for the other manager classes.  It serves as a common interface for
 * the Simulation Manager to work with the various object managers.

 * <br>November 6, 2012 - Took away mp_oSimManager's static designation; it
 * interfered with testing
