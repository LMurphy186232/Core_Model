/**
 * WORKER BASE - Version 1.0
 *
 * The worker base class serves as a virtual base class for all data and
 * behavior objects. These object types each have their own managers. The
 * managers themselves have a base class and this object allows that manager
 * base class to access the objects.
 *
 * This class only serves as a parent class for other classes; do not
 * instantiate objects of this class.
 *
 * In order for the dynamic casting to work, this must be a polymorphic base
 * class, which means it must have a virtual function. So make sure there's
 * always one.
 *
 * There are is a virtual function that all child classes must overload.

 * <br>November 6, 2012 - Made mp_oSimManager not static. It interfered with
 * testing. (LEM)
 * <br>November 12, 2012 - Chars became strings (LEM)
