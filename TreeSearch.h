/**
* Tree Search Class - Version 1.1
* This class controls the feeding of individual trees to behavior
* objects.  For each request for a population to return a set of trees, a
* treeSearch object will be created.  It will keep the required search
* attributes and control the tree flow.
*
* When a clTreeSearch object is returned as a result of a query to a
* clTreePopulation object, use NextTree() (including for the first tree) to
* return trees until NextTree() returns NULL, indicating the end of the list.
*
* A clTreeSearch object acts like a simultaneous placeholder and filter in the
* hash table.  It keeps its place and, when NextTree() is called, sifts through
* until it finds the next tree meeting the appropriate criteria.
*
* The clTreeSearch class and the clTreePopulation class are friends of each
* other. This lets them access each other's methods and data, which is
* importantvbecause the tree searching code lives in the clTreeSearch object
* but accesses trees in the clTreePopulation object.
*
* Requirements for a successful search:
* <ul>
* <li>All types and species must be valid.
* <li>No negative numbers.
* <li>Points to calculate distance from must be within the plot.
* <li>If you specify height, you must specify distance.
* <li>If you do a distance/height search, you cannot specify any other search
*   parameters.
* </ul>

* <br>Edit history:
* <br>-----------------
* <br>April 28, 2004 - Submitted as beta (LEM)
* <br>March 3, 2005 - Changed species from bit-shifting int to bool array (LEM)
* <br>August 14, 2007 - Decided to skip edge testing for distance-height
* searches. It makes sense in theory but most searches are 10 meters or less.
* Plus there's a bug - short end cells are treated as full-size and may lead
* to their regular-sized neighbors being skipped. (LEM)
