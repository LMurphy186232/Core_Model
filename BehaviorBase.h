/**
* BehaviorBase - Version 2.0
* This class acts as a virtual parent for all behavior classes.  This allows
* the Simulation Manager to work with behavior objects without knowing anything
* about them.
*
* There should not be any objects instantiated from this class.
*
* Because I am continually surprised at the basic functions I want to mess with
* in my derived classes, every function here is virtual.  Most administrative
* dealings with behaviors have them cast to the clBehaviorBase class, so
* function-hiding won't work.  Override to your heart's content.

* <br>Edit history:
* <br>-----------------
* <br>October 20, 2011 - Wiped the slate clean for SORTIE 7.0; created
* version 2.0 (LEM)
* <br>May 18, 2015 - Changed GetParentParametersElement so it wasn't an
* error if element was not found (LEM)
